OMG! A month!
Need to get this branch working so that I can close it and do REAL testing!
Forgot how to call RSpec. Bummer, need to just keep the fingers moving.


Monday 11/30
doing TDD and BDD with Rspec
want user to checkout the site
  able to view the front material with mock up of class creation, student input, and attendance
  able to navigate to about, help and home pages 
  able to sign up or sign in

  all other pages are for teachers only
  user must sign up to be a teacher
  teachers can 
    create a class
    delete a class
    create a student
    delete a student
    take attendance 
    send email to delete
      self

use Devise for authentication.....NO!! just read github docs and not recommended so early in my learning.

Now RailsCasts by Ryan Bates and create app auth.
