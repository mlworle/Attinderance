<h1>Attinderance | New Student</h1>
<p>This page will allow the user/teacher to input the data for a new student. Right now that is only one string field for name. Access to the database needs to be established.</p>
<p><%= render 'form'%>
   <%= link_to 'Back', students_path%>
</p>
<p>Find me in app/views/students/new.html.erb</p>
